            <h2>Water Quality</h2>
            <p>Water is a valuable resource, so there is strong demand for the monitoring of specific compounds and chemical contaminants in water. These include the content of nitrogen or the organic load of industrial waste water, the quality of drinking water or the concentration of chemicals in coastal/seawater.</p>

            <h2>Monitoring of the atmosphere</h2>
            <h2>Air Quality</h2>
            <p>Despite the increasing importance of renewable energy, levels of atmospheric pollution are increasing rapidly as a result of burning fossil fuels and biomass as well as industrial processes. Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) allows for the open-air monitoring of pollutants such as ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2).</p>

            <h2>Climate changes and land degradation</h2>
            <h2>Soil Quality</h2>
            <p>In times of accelerating climate change, optimized soil treatment is essential for agricultural productivity and the prevention of land degradation. Unsustainable agricultural soil treatment combined with extreme weather conditions such as flooding, high temperatures and drought presents farmers with problems like soil compaction, nutrient depletion or excess nutrient supply. VIS-NIR soil spectroscopy helps to understand soil health and ensures food safety.</p>

            <h2>Environment Quality</h2>
            <p>Rising levels of pollution and the deterioration in quality of our natural water will be an ongoing challenge for the future. Parameters such as turbidity, chemical and biological oxygen demand, nitrates and chloride are Indicators of the water condition in rivers, lakes, coastal or maritime regions. They have to be tracked in order to protect the environment and detect harmful sources of contamination.</p>
